[Panda3D Wheel for macOS 10.9+ (Python3.9, x86_64)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_6WJxrkNfwisK5pe5ubJJy1psEp0IIft/view?usp=sharing)

Installing the provided Panda3D wheel requires Python 3.9, which is not installed on your system by default whatsoever.  We recommend installing Python 3.9 through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (Make sure that the xcode command line tools are installed first `xcode-select --install`): 
```shell
$ brew install python@3.9
```
(This will symlink Python 3.9 to `python3.9` and pip to `pip3`).

After installing Python 3.9.  You can then install the wheel by using pip:
```shell
$ pip install panda3d-1.11.0-cp39-cp39-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl
```
