Installing the provided Panda3D wheel requires Python 3.9, which is not installed on your system by default whatsoever.  We recommend installing Python 3.9 through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (Make sure that the xcode command line tools are installed first `xcode-select --install`): 
```shell
$ brew install python@3.9
```
(This will symlink Python 3.9 to `python3.9` and pip to `pip3`).

After installing Python 3.9.  You can then install the wheel by using pip:
```shell
$ pip install panda3d-1.11.0-cp39-cp39-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl
```

## GNU/Linux

* Install "Bottles"
* Create a gaming bottle
* Copy strut folder to C drive
* Open WINE CMD
* CD into folder and run:
```

```
